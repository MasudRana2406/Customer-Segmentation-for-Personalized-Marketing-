# Customer Segmentation for Personalized Marketing

This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their demographics and purchasing behaviour, helping retailers deliver **personalized marketing strategies**.

---

## Project Overview

The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle’s Mall Customers Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/heeraldedhia/kmeans-clustering-for-customer-data).
The goal is to identify **distinct customer segments** using variables like **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**, and interpret their characteristics to support **data-driven retail decisions**.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**

   * Imported and inspected customer dataset using Pandas
   * Checked data types, missing values, and distribution patterns

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visualized distributions using histograms, boxplots, and count plots
   * Analyzed statistical summaries to understand customer income and spending variation

3. **Feature Selection & Curve Fitting**

   * Studied relationships between independent and dependent variables
   * Prepared data for clustering

4. **Customer Segmentation with K-Means**

   * Applied **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine optimal clusters
   * Visualized clusters using scatter plots to highlight unique customer groups

---

## Results & Insights

* Identified **five distinct customer clusters**, each representing a unique combination of income and spending patterns.
* Segmentation helps in **targeting high-value customers**, optimizing promotions, and enhancing store-level decisions.
* The analysis supports **personalized marketing**, improving engagement and customer retention.

## Tools & Libraries

**Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, **SciPy**

---

## Future Enhancements

* Integrate **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** metrics for deeper behavioral insights
* Apply **DBSCAN** or **Gaussian Mixture Models** for comparison
* Deploy segmentation dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Power BI**
